# Learn Java Hashmap in real world problems

## Problem 1

```java

Given a list of exchange rates between currencies, write a function that calculates currency rate between any 2 currencies.

(GBP, EUR, 10)     - read as "1 GBP equals 10 EUR"
(EUR, USD, 1.1)    - "1 EUR equals 1.1 USD"
(USD, JPY, 108.3)
(CNY, RUB, 14.6)
*/

// GBP-> EUR = 10
// GBP -> USD => GPB -> EUR -> USD

// <CUR, MAP> 
// GBP -> MAP<CUR, num> -> EUR -> 10
// GBP -> MAP<CUR, MAP<>> -> EUR<CUR, num>

// n pair currentcy,  2n currencies

class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    }
