# Learn Java Hashmap in real world problems

## Problem 1. Currency Exchange

```java
/*
We are a currency exchange that maintains the current exchange rates between currencies. A user can come to us with some amount in one currency and request the equivalent amount in a different currency. Given a list of exchange rates between currencies, write a function that calculates currency rate between any 2 currencies.

(GBP, EUR, 10)     - read as "1 GBP equals 10 EUR"
(EUR, USD, 1.1)    - "1 EUR equals 1.1 USD"
(USD, JPY, 108.3)
(CNY, RUB, 14.6)
*/


class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    }
}

```

## Question 2. Operator Assignment
```java
- Initializes with a set of available operators.
- set_limit(operator_name, n)
  Sets an operatorâ€™s limit.
- assign(conversation_id)
  Assigns a given conversation to the next available operator.
- get_assignment_queue(n)
  Returns the list of possible operators in the order they will be assigned to conversations, not real assignment yet.
```



## Question 3. Log Analyzer
```java
/*
Design a log analyzer that processes server logs and provides statistics:
- Most frequent IP addresses
- Count of each HTTP status code (200, 404, 500, etc.)
- Most requested URLs
- Peak traffic times

Input: List of log entries in format: "timestamp IP_address URL status_code response_time"
Example: "2023-05-15T14:22:33 192.168.1.1 /home 200 150"

Implement methods:
- void processLog(String logEntry)
- Map<String, Integer> getTopIPs(int n)
- Map<Integer, Integer> getStatusCodeCounts()
- String getMostRequestedURL()
- String getPeakHour()
*/
```

## Question 4. Product Inventory System
```java
/*
Design a product inventory system with the following operations:
- add(productId, quantity): Add products to inventory
- remove(productId, quantity): Remove products from inventory
- getAvailableQuantity(productId): Get current quantity
- getProductsInRange(minPrice, maxPrice): Get products in price range
- getLowStockProducts(threshold): Get products below threshold quantity

Products have: ID, name, price, and quantity.
Optimize for fast lookups by ID and efficient range queries.
*/
```

## Question 5. Word Frequency Counter with Synonyms
```java
/*
Implement a word frequency counter that:
- Counts occurrences of each word in a document

- Returns the top N most frequent words

Example:
Document: "The car is fast. The automobile is red."
Synonyms: {"car", "automobile"}
Result: {"the": 2, "car": 2, "is": 2, "fast": 1, "red": 1}

Implement:

- get(key): Get item by key (and mark as recently used)
- getMostRecentlyUsed(): Return most recently used item
- getLeastRecentlyUsed(): Return least recently used item

- removeItem(productId)
- updateQuantity(productId, newQuantity)
- getCartTotal(): Calculate total price
- applyDiscount(discountCode)
- checkout(): Process the order and clear cart

Products have varying prices and some may have discounts.
Multiple discount codes may be applied with different rules.
*/
```

## Question 10. Task Scheduler with Dependencies
```java
/*
Design a task scheduler that handles tasks with dependencies:
- addTask(taskId, executionTime)
- addDependency(taskId, dependsOnTaskId)
- removeDependency(taskId, dependsOnTaskId)
- getExecutionOrder(): Return valid execution order
- getEarliestExecutionTime(taskId): Calculate earliest possible start time

Tasks cannot start until all dependencies are completed.
Detect and handle circular dependencies.
*/
```

## Question 11. Stock Portfolio Tracker
```java
/*
Implement a stock portfolio tracker:
- buyShares(symbol, quantity, price)
- sellShares(symbol, quantity, price)
- getCurrentHoldings(): Map of stock symbols to quantities
- getAveragePurchasePrice(symbol)
- getPortfolioValue(currentPrices): Calculate total value
- getProfitLoss(currentPrices): Calculate profit/loss

Track multiple transactions per stock and handle partial sells correctly.
*/
```

## Question 12. Document Indexing System
```java
/*
Design a document indexing system for fast keyword searches:
- addDocument(docId, content)
- removeDocument(docId)
- updateDocument(docId, newContent)
- search(keyword): Return all documents containing the keyword
- searchMultiple(keywords, useAND): Search with multiple keywords
- rankResults(docIds): Rank results by relevance (keyword frequency)

Optimize for fast search operations across many documents.
*/
```

## Challenges
Real-world challenges including:
- Complex data modeling
- Efficient lookups and updates
