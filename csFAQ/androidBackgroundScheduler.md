## 1. WorkManager

WorkManager is Google's recommended solution for deferrable background work.

### Key Features
- Works across device reboots
- Respects battery optimization features
- Handles constraints (network, charging, etc.)
- Supports one-time and periodic tasks
- Provides work chaining and parallel execution
- Backwards compatible to API 14

### Best For
- Tasks that should run even if the app is closed
- Work that needs to be guaranteed to execute
- Background operations with specific constraints
- Periodic background tasks

### Sample Code
```kotlin
val constraints = Constraints.Builder()
    .setRequiredNetworkType(NetworkType.CONNECTED)
    .setRequiresBatteryNotLow(true)
    .build()

val uploadWorkRequest = OneTimeWorkRequestBuilder<UploadWorker>()
    .setConstraints(constraints)
    .setBackoffCriteria(BackoffPolicy.LINEAR, 10, TimeUnit.MINUTES)
    .build()

WorkManager.getInstance(context).enqueue(uploadWorkRequest)

// Worker implementation
class UploadWorker(context: Context, params: WorkerParameters) : Worker(context, params) {
    override fun doWork(): Result {
        // Perform background work
        return if (success) Result.success() else Result.retry()
    }
}
```

## 2. AlarmManager

AlarmManager provides access to system alarm services, allowing you to schedule your application to run at a specific time.

### Key Features
- Precise timing control
- Works when the app is not running
- Survives device reboots (with special handling)
- Can wake up the device

### Best For
- Time-critical operations
- Alarms and reminders
- Tasks that need to run at exact times

### Limitations
- Ignores battery optimization
- No built-in network constraints
- Potentially high battery impact

### Sample Code
```kotlin
val alarmManager = context.getSystemService(Context.ALARM_SERVICE) as AlarmManager
val intent = Intent(context, AlarmReceiver::class.java)
val pendingIntent = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(
    context, 0, intent, PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE
)

// For exact timing (requires SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM permission on API 31+)
alarmManager.setExactAndAllowWhileIdle(
    AlarmManager.RTC_WAKEUP,
    System.currentTimeMillis() + 60000, // 1 minute from now
    pendingIntent
)
```

## 3. JobScheduler

JobScheduler is Android's native job scheduling service introduced in API 21 (Lollipop).

### Key Features
- Battery-friendly
- Supports various constraints
- Batch processing of jobs
- Survives app restarts

### Best For
- Deferred tasks with constraints
- Background work on newer devices
- Battery-conscious operations

### Limitations
- Only available on API 21+
- Less precise timing than AlarmManager
- No direct backward compatibility

### Sample Code
```kotlin
val jobScheduler = context.getSystemService(Context.JOB_SCHEDULER_SERVICE) as JobScheduler

val componentName = ComponentName(context, ExampleJobService::class.java)
val jobInfo = JobInfo.Builder(JOB_ID, componentName)
    .setRequiredNetworkType(JobInfo.NETWORK_TYPE_ANY)
    .setRequiresCharging(true)
    .setPersisted(true) // Survives reboots
    .build()

jobScheduler.schedule(jobInfo)

// JobService implementation
class ExampleJobService : JobService() {
    override fun onStartJob(params: JobParameters?): Boolean {
        // Return true if job needs to continue on a separate thread
        return true
    }

    override fun onStopJob(params: JobParameters?): Boolean {
        // Return true to reschedule the job
        return false
    }
}
```

## 4. Foreground Services

Foreground services perform operations that are noticeable to the user, displaying a persistent notification.

### Key Features
- Immediate execution
- High priority (less likely to be killed)
- User awareness via notification
- Can run indefinitely

### Best For
- Immediate, user-visible operations
- Long-running tasks (music playback, location tracking)
- Tasks that must not be deferred

### Limitations
- Requires user notification
- Higher battery consumption
- Subject to background restrictions in newer Android versions

### Sample Code
```kotlin
// In your Activity/Fragment
Intent(context, ForegroundService::class.java).also { intent ->
    if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.O) {
        context.startForegroundService(intent)
    } else {
        context.startService(intent)
    }
}

// Service implementation
class ForegroundService : Service() {
    override fun onStartCommand(intent: Intent?, flags: Int, startId: Int): Int {
        val notification = createNotification()
        startForeground(NOTIFICATION_ID, notification)
        
        // Perform work
        
        return START_NOT_STICKY
    }
    
    // Other required methods...
}
```

## 5. Coroutines (Immediate Background Processing)

Kotlin Coroutines provide a way to perform asynchronous operations without blocking the main thread.

### Key Features
- Lightweight threading
- Structured concurrency
- Easy cancellation
- Integration with lifecycle components

### Best For
- UI-related background tasks
- Short-lived operations
- Tasks that should be canceled when the user leaves

### Limitations
- Not for persistent background work
- Doesn't survive process death
- No built-in scheduling capabilities

### Sample Code
```kotlin
// In a ViewModel
private val viewModelScope = CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Main + Job())

fun performBackgroundTask() {
    viewModelScope.launch {
        val result = withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
            // Perform background work
            fetchDataFromNetwork()
        }
        // Update UI with result
    }
}

// In an Activity/Fragment with lifecycle awareness
lifecycleScope.launch {
    // This coroutine is automatically canceled when the lifecycle is destroyed
    val result = withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
        // Background work
    }
}
```


## 6. Handling Doze Mode

Introduced in Android 6.0 (API 23), Doze mode is a system state that restricts app background operations to conserve battery when the device is idle.

### How Doze Mode Works
- Activates when screen is off and device is stationary for a period
- Restricts network access, wake locks, and standard AlarmManager alarms
- Operates in maintenance windows where restrictions are temporarily lifted

### How Each Scheduler Handles Doze Mode
#### WorkManager
- Designed to work with Doze mode
- Jobs are batched and executed during maintenance windows
- No special handling required by developers

```kotlin
// WorkManager automatically handles Doze mode
val workRequest = OneTimeWorkRequestBuilder<DataSyncWorker>()
    .build()
WorkManager.getInstance(context).enqueue(workRequest)
```
#### AlarmManager
- Standard alarms are deferred during Doze
- Special methods available for critical alarms:
```kotlin
// Will be deferred in Doze mode
alarmManager.set(AlarmManager.RTC, triggerTime, pendingIntent)

// Will fire even in Doze mode, but limited to once per 9 minutes per app
alarmManager.setAndAllowWhileIdle(AlarmManager.RTC_WAKEUP, triggerTime, pendingIntent)

// For critical alarms, limited to once per 9 minutes per app
alarmManager.setExactAndAllowWhileIdle(AlarmManager.RTC_WAKEUP, triggerTime, pendingIntent)
 ```
```
#### JobScheduler
- Natively aware of Doze mode
- Jobs are batched and executed during maintenance windows
- Can specify minimum latency for time-sensitive jobs
```kotlin
val jobInfo = JobInfo.Builder(JOB_ID, componentName)
    // This job will be eligible to run during Doze maintenance windows
    .setRequiredNetworkType(JobInfo.NETWORK_TYPE_ANY)
    // For more urgent jobs, set minimum latency
    .setMinimumLatency(TimeUnit.MINUTES.toMillis(10))
    .build()
```

#### Foreground Services
- Can continue running during Doze mode
- Subject to some restrictions on network access
- Consider using FCM for triggering time-sensitive operations
// Foreground services can run during Doze, but network operations may be restricted
class DozeAwareForegroundService : Service() {
    override fun onStartCommand(intent: Intent?, flags: Int, startId: Int): Int {
        startForeground(NOTIFICATION_ID, createNotification())
        
        // For network operations during Doze, consider batching or deferring
        if (isDeviceInDozeMode(this)) {
            scheduleNetworkOperationForMaintenanceWindow()
        } else {
            performNetworkOperationImmediately()
        }
        
        return START_STICKY
    }
    
    private fun isDeviceInDozeMode(context: Context): Boolean {
        val powerManager = context.getSystemService(Context.POWER_SERVICE) as PowerManager
        return if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.M) {
            powerManager.isDeviceIdleMode
        } else {
            false
        }
    }
}

### Best Practices for Doze Mode
1. Use FCM for urgent notifications
   
   - Firebase Cloud Messaging can wake apps during Doze
   - High-priority FCM messages are delivered immediately
2. Request temporary exemptions when necessary
   
   - Request users add your app to battery optimization exemptions for critical use cases
   - Don't abuse this privilege

```java
// Check if app is ignoring battery optimizations
fun isIgnoringBatteryOptimizations(context: Context): Boolean {
    val powerManager = context.getSystemService(Context.POWER_SERVICE) as PowerManager
    val packageName = context.packageName
    return if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.M) {
        powerManager.isIgnoringBatteryOptimizations(packageName)
    } else {
        true // Before Marshmallow, no Doze mode
    }
}

// Request to be added to whitelist (use sparingly and only when necessary)
fun requestIgnoreBatteryOptimizations(context: Context) {
    if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.M) {
        val intent = Intent(Settings.ACTION_REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS).apply {
            data = Uri.parse("package:${context.packageName}")
        }
        context.startActivity(intent)
    }
}
```
## Decision Flowchart
```
Start
  |
  v
Is the task time-critical with exact timing?
  |
  +-- Yes --> Is it critical enough to wake device from Doze? 
  |             |
  |             +-- Yes --> Use AlarmManager.setExactAndAllowWhileIdle
  |             |
  |             +-- No --> Use AlarmManager (standard)
  v
Does the task need to run even if the app is closed?
  |
  +-- No --> Can use Coroutines
  |
  v
Does the task need to show ongoing notification to user?
  |
  +-- Yes --> Use Foreground Service
  |
  v
Does the task have specific constraints (network, battery)?
  |
  +-- Yes --> Use WorkManager (or JobScheduler on newer devices)
  |
  v
Is Doze mode compatibility important?
  |
  +-- Yes --> Use WorkManager
  |
  v
Default: Use WorkManager for most background tasks
```

## Best Practices

1. **Prefer WorkManager** for most background tasks
2. **Use Foreground Services sparingly** due to their impact on battery and user experience
3. **Avoid AlarmManager** unless exact timing is critical
4. **Consider battery impact** when choosing a scheduling mechanism
5. **Test on different Android versions** as behavior can vary
6. **Handle process death** appropriately for your chosen solution
7. **Respect Doze mode and App Standby** in newer Android versions
