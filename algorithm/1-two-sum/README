Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.


## why we can't sort
If the question is asking for values, we can sort find the two values using two pointers.

But the question is asking indices.

## Solution: brutal force
Two scan by index, it's very simple to understand and come up with.

## Solution map
It's also intuitive to use a value to index map. In this approach, we will scan once and calculate the value and get the index.

Though the first thoght is building the map, and use the map. It fails because it has a assumption that the given array has no duplicated elements, but it's not true.

The correct way is to scan and build the map. It also will only keep the first occurrence of duplicated element.

When you check an element `value`, you check the `map(target-value)`
