行为问题准备
回答的方式分成五个部分
1. 根据对问题的理解，将其分成几大类（少于 1分钟）
	* 技术方面：需要突出技术攻关能力，精益求精的思想以及对技术的热情
	* 团队合作方面：如何快速融入团队，如何沟通，如何激励队员
	* 个人性格：是否正直，是否乐于助人
2. 简述对问题的理解，叙述方法论（少于 1分钟）
3. 叙述该公司对应类别的故事，一方面体现你喜欢该公司，愿意学习和了解他们的文化，另一方面这些故事是“正确”的答案，因为是高管在书中叙述，希望大家学习的。（1分钟左右）
4. 叙述你自己对应的故事（3分钟）
5. 总结（1分钟）

问：如果在产品开发的时候，你上司想加一个团队不喜欢的功能，这时候怎么做？
1. 分类：这是个团队合作方面的问题
2. 方法论：
	1. 收集资料，列出加上此功能后对产品进行的正面以及负面影响。
	2. 分析资料，给出团队以及自己的建议，提供备选方案或者减少负面影响。
3. 公司故事：谷歌的 AdWords 问世的时候，创始人布林想让瓦米的工程师团队执行一个方案，但是他并没有提出极具说服力的论据，所以瓦米并不认同这个方案。布林提出一个折衷方案让瓦米一半团队执行布林的防范，一半听瓦米指挥。但是瓦米仍然不同意，双方继续争论两个方案的优缺点，最后，布林的方案被放弃。
4. 叙述你自己的团队合作的故事
5. 总结：下属必须勇于直言，要形成“表达异议的义务”，当有人认为某个方案有错误的地方，他们必须提出顾虑，否则，一旦不好的方案通过，他们要为过失负责，同时也影响产品发展。

这个问题也可以转变身份：

问：如果你是上司，你想加一个功能，但是下属不同意的话，这时候怎么做？
总结：如果你身居要位，当对负责的职务不够专业，很容易试图用“我说这样做，就得这样做”的方法论来恐吓胁迫下属，但是你必须对自己的团队有信心，并有足够的执行放手让他们找到更好的方法。

## STAR method

The STAR method is a really popular approach for answering behavioral questions because it’s easy to remember:

- Situation: 

	Start by outlining the situation you were in, and provide necessary context (Your role, the team, the organization, the market, etc.).

- Task: 

	Next, describe the problem that needed a solution. Also, explain your responsibility and what you decided to do about it.

- Action: 

	Then step through how you went about implementing your solution, and focus on your contribution.

- Result: 

	Finally, summarize with an analysis of your actions, highlighting the positive impact it had for your team, department, and organization, and emphasize what you learned.

## why facebook

- Products. 
	* facebook, facebook messagener
	* instagram
	* Whatsapp 
	* two of the most successful products in the world with billions of users. React is one of most successful Front end libary in the world. I want to build or contribute to those successful product.

- People. 
	+ two colleges
		+ Both of them are the most creative and optimistic guy in out team. Sometimes I check their Facebook post, I feel like they have a very bright, happy life. They do lot of cool work and a lot of cool playing. They do a lot of cool works in a lot of cool planes I feel like I want to be one of them.

- Values
	+ be bold
	+ focus on impact
	+ move fast
	+ be open
	+ build social value
- Mission. 

	If the mission of the company truly resonates with you then you should definitely mention it. In our experience, this works best with smaller start-ups who are trying to build something new and typically have a strong vision. But it's still worth reading about the mission and vision of the bigger companies you are interviewing with (e.g. Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, etc.) to see if it resonates with you.

### Example

	I want to work at Facebook for three reasons.

	First, I've worked on messaging products for the past few years and I'm excited to join the FB Messenger team because the work it does impacts more than 1 billion people. This is a truly unique opportunity.

	Second, two of my friends are working in Facebook. I really enjoyed my casual discussion with her as she seemed to be truly passionate about working for Facebook.

	Finally, I'm attracted to Facebook's culture of moving fast and being bold. These are some of the values I'm implementing in my own work and I'm excited to join a team that thinks along similar lines.

- products
- people
- values
- mission


## Tell me about yourself
	Hi my name is zhenfang and I'm a Senior Android software engineer. I mainly focus on building reliable, scalables android apps for IoT industry.

	I have been working in computer science industry for almost 10 years and been across a lot of part. From traditional desktoip application, feature phone reference design, e-commercial apps , VOIP app and IoT apps.

	I have built or be part of some very successful applications which has millions of users in South East Asia, I also had some product which has never seen its real end user. These experiences shaped me.

	During my 10 years working experience this I learned a lot of technologies, old and new,markets schetigies, hacky or not, management, and company strategies involding planning, designing, and developing, promoting some product

	I define my self as a engineer focused person, but not engineer only. I hold a view that Engineer can solve a lot of tech problems, but some other kills can make tech problem go away. 

	I always belive that a partly done product used to user is much better than the perfect product exist only in developer's computer as long as it brings positive value to users. 
	
	So overall, I'm not limited my self as an engineer, I'd rather be an engineer with a sense of product.

## Leadership and complex scope of work:

- Experience in driving complex large scale engineering efforts e.g. What is the most technically complex project you’ve done and what was your role in it?
- Tell me about a recent / favorite project and some of the difficulties you had

	<details><summary>The new IoT platform: Corehub</summary>

		S: Before I jump to my project I like to introduce some backgrounds and context of it. Coretex had a big embedded system productit which is a double edged sword. It generates most of company's revenue, but it has a lot of problem, But two of them are significant, they slow company down, increase company's expense by large. The first is the developed and fixing bycle, the second is installing and maintaining.

		The system was written in C++ and are based on Linux. It's good but lacking ecosystem makes it slow in development because we have to write almost very thing from scratch, like drivers for hardware, databae, config parsing, internet communication, low power mode, app crashing and restarting. Also it's wired so that our installer need to disassmble the whole vehicle to install one, and do it again to replace a faulty one. It costs us a lot money to do that.

		T: I joined in this company in this context. The company needs a new generation product to overcome all those drawbackand and provides reliable, scalable, and maintainable, power efficiency, customizable, wireless, and secure and relatively short develop cycle. This is a huge challenge because this requirement is so vague you don't have any fixed requirements except these adjectives. I was assign the task to exploring all the possible options and especially Android.

		A: In the high-level have explored a lot of options, linux, Android IoT, some SoC solution, but every of them failed in one way or another. But Android platform looked very promising. It's mature and it has fabulous ecosystem. If we look at a normal Android system is quite like what do we want. 
		- It's a reliable because any broken up app not going to crash the system
		- It's scalable the idea of Google play store can install new application and update the existing application;
		- It's power efficiency because an android app doesn't consume much battery if he's not running CPU intensive tasks
		- And is wireless supports classic Bluetooth and low energy Bluetooth which is all we want it.
		- reliable

		- scalable 
		- maintainable
		- power efficiency
		- customizable
		- wireless
		- secure

		 I collected the information and had a discussion with CTO to achived a decision that Android is the way we'll go. After the decision to use the Android, I began the architecture design. This work involves a lot of discussion clarification, iteration, demostration and feeback. 

		First of all I made a decision that's the IoT platform is not a single huge application instead of some difference applications as different components communicating with each other by mechanism provided by Android.

		Then I divided them into three different layers, to core layers, the supporting layers and the features layers.
		 
		The core layers provides the basic functionality like persistence, app manage, config manage, firmware manager, watchdog, and so on so forth. 

		The supporting layers provided some functionality like internet communication, bluetooth device cummunication, accelerometer management.

		Then The last the layer is the real feature layer, what functionalities need by user is in this layer. It's build based on core layer and supporting layer

		Then I finshed the graph of the architecture and explained to the CTO. Then CTO will ask some questions which might require me design revise, more requirements are provided which lead to the more detailed design. After many iterations the first completed design is done and we think the design will be our next generation of platform. 

		Then I started to work on the proof of concept work. I buildt the core layers and some of the support layer in minimum level. Based on that.The Poc work is basically a Google play store so you can install new apps, upgrade exist apps from remote config, all these procedure Should be completed without physical touch. It's successful and I presented to the board and get the permision to put the product into half year product map.
		
		Then I built the MVP, Based on the POC, I added position update and sensor manager so that the unit can upload position to server and connect sensors and get message from sensor. 
		
		Then I have done a lot of demos to the CTO to some of the colleagues into the board members which are all very successful. Then the company made the decision that this is what we needed, new recruites are added, and development are going, then, field test, then production.

		The complex of the task is in some whole diffrent levels. I have to design from scratch with unclear requirment, and I have persvate CTO, CEO, board member it's the right way to go and get the resources to start the product develop.

- Mentorship/ coaching
	
	<details><summary>Mentoring & coching</summary>
	Coaching happens before teammate contributes any code, mentoriing happens all the time.

	Whenever a team member join my team, by recruite or transfor from other team, I will demostrate the The backgrounds of our project, the design and architecture of our project. 
	
	After the architecture then will go to the Andoird fundamental. I'm only focus on introducing the concept of android and why android environment is for difference from the desktop app, app life cycle. Then I will introduce the structure of one app, How this app is communicating with others parts, how message flow across inside and outside.

	Mentoring happens mainly on PR review. For a PR, I mainly focus on whether the design of this PR makes sense in Andorid world. Whether implementation follows our data flow rule, clean structure, no heavy duty code runs on main thread. one to one explaination is provided if something fundamentally wrong expecially in the early stage.

	After sometime, this kind of mentoring is less and less. But sometime, I'll take a chance to help some member to go one step deep in unserstanding Andorid, understanding development.

	<details><summary>Kotlin/Coroutin</summary>

	</details>

	<details><summary>git flow, CI/CD</summary>

	I keeps refining the gits flow. We used to normal git flow font on the website. Master, develop, feature, PR. But it's first we were struggling with the versioning, Since it's very hard to choose how many I have included in one release and what're the version for every app.

	For something different in our team is we are not a single app we are a bunch of apps. When we do release, It's a bunch of app it's very hard to see this app A 1.0, app b 2.0. It hurts to Test and trace back. Then I added the idea of the vertical app for one single release we have released a vertical version like 1.2.3 and in this vertical version we have a lot of different applications in different versions. 

	I modified recruit of failed to provide a single top level vertical version and also for everything version we have different version, Integrate the version system to the CI/CD, So that every vertical working will go to one folder in our server,Reads there are different versions of apps. Also I A third of the CD that whenever you dispute is triggered the tag is attached to the kids history to say Apple one version one of two version two as well as the vertical version.

	Almost all the work done by CI/CD, Our engineer are happy and QA are also happy.

## Feedback

- Can you give an example of a valuable piece of feedback that you have received?
	<details><summary>Too aggresive At new technology</summary>
	Moving too fast. Too aggresive to integrate new library, technology and stuff into the code base.

	Something I learned, coaching, tutorial must be follow/before as a team.
	</details>
- When did you receive constructive/negative/difficult feedback? How did you act upon this?
	<details><summary>Don't afraid UI</summary>

	That was awkward. When I was working in Singapore that's three in our team to build a app.  
	
	How we split the work is that one college works on a whole feature and another colleage and I are working together on a feature. I do the backend and he willdo the front.
	
	At the end of year, my manager give feedback like that I shouldn't only do the backend just because of you're not good at it. I thougt about it and said ok. Then we switched our working style from two people working together to one people working on a full feature. In the beginning is quite hard to get to UI correct, How to make Two buttons and one tax in one line while As it takes to be laying on top of the top button instead of the middle. After while I grab it I find this quite fulfilling to do the UI work. And it gives you more Sophistication and confidence with the user really visually use your work, to buy stuff for sale stuff or get more information.

	I'm very thankful to that feedback, It's changed my mindset from nah to yes. I don't want to do it because I'm not good at it to I want to give a try that maybe I can get it. I get more confident to jump out of my comfortable zone to do harder work.

## Teamwork/ Empathy

- How would your co-workers describe you? Who is your favorite co-worker? 
	<details><summary>Passionate, knowledgeable and improving</summary>
	- I have knowledge from across the industries
	- Frontend, mobile, backend, gaming
	- Cloud, docker
	- Linux/MacOS/Window
	- CI/CD, yaml, devops

	I keep improving in my Andorid and others. I got mail letter for Android weekly, kotlin weekly, Javascript weekly. I scan the titles and read some articles I'm intrested. 

	Sometimes, our team has a hard tech problem and the potential solution might be long and nasty. And one week or two weeks later, I proposed a solution that never metioned before which is clean and sufficient. They'll like How did you do that.

	Be open and be ready to learn.

	<details><summary>surprising one: Introducing redux</summary>

		Speaking back to the cradle that we have the app and we have a Console live web app which do all administration work for the orgination. The code was pure React without any state management machnism. It's 2007 when Redux is status quo industry standard. The colds are deeply coupled by passing down the up all kinds of **setting* function. It makes code hard to read, and even harder to fixing bugs. 
		
		Most common bug is You click the button and some content is changed in this page but when you go to another page it's still show the old data.
		
		When we were discussing some issues it's always like all this this bug is because the logic is too complex and fixed one bug sometime break another logic, another fix sometime break another logic. It delays our progress a lot.
		
		I took this question to some of my frontend frient, it turned out the redux is perfect solution to our project because it provides gloal state managemet. Besides the debugging tool is amazing. But we discussing the redus, the college gave a no with concern too complex, too big. 

		But from the article I read the reduction is not that complex to introduce, it  will not introduce new bugs but diminish bugs because it makes the whole development cycle clear and clean. I decided to get my hand dirty.

		In the weekends I create a new branch from the current project and rewrite one feature with the redux, And the result is surprisingly good. Not only the logics looks cleaner and easier to understand, and the abstract idea of action, producers and data help you maintain a good understanding of data flow.

- Tell me about a time you struggled to work with one of your colleagues

	<details><summary>too much talking</summary>

	While all this embarrassing are you the heavens as a first year. In New Zealand we have a small team of five people I think and we are all in the small office this can you open the office and one of my colleagues he's very like active and relaxed. I can see that sometimes he mean no harm but he keeps responding any noise anyone mate in this office like sometimes when I was calling maybe this abuse in the lower voice have you talk to myself I will talk to the product in my ultimate desk that's how is my progress what is my problem hallway and Aliza problem how can I find a solution how is a current solution something like that every time when I have a son have you ask what's up man do you have any problem what's wrong what's interesting also some of things.At first I have a response or nothing I was just thinking to myself but Weeks and the Mum sees things too much and I try to talk to him that but it looks no help.Sometimes the questioning asking is just you alter your zoom and you spent money more minutes to go back you to Zone and then he give you out of Xinhe for minutes later it's disturbing and stressful reason.I talked to him I told talked with him about the station.

	<details><summary>If else refactor</summary>

		- Wow it is experience that I can never forgot. I did a very good interview and was hired as a senior software engineer who is the company the companies working on the security product state stock and stalking application. Summer for logis A silver complete it because of the nature of the stock. Increasing in seven days decreasing is like 30 days in one year and one month in this scenario you have to replace this I'd put in the scenario you have to generate another output. This is crazy that you have like 50 conditions to process process some sort of data and then generate some output.

		Are that's what I have learnt from the books if else if this condition do you something else if some condition do something else if that is the same condition else if some condition else if some condition.
		It looks okay but when I delivered the future one of the manager in business team say oh no this is rubbish because then without the old software do you know roughly what day that will be achieved so much this dataset. He has some deficit he know roughly what should be achieved in the deserts when he run with May didn't programs that you need dramatically different still sets which means the organism is not correct. Then I rewrite the road roads multiple times none of the program algorithm have them good enough solution. I feel it's very embarrassed and struggled and sometimes everything alright with Esther to quit. After some trace my manager came to me said are you okay do you think you can get get it. Maybe not. Then he said it's okay let's do it together.

		Then he use my computer to grab my keyboard is 32 ratings are called first of all less scanning analyses all the conditions. Let's find the most impossible case in this case only something can be done return then something less common to Summer Zhang return. After a few returns logics become clear because remaining longnecks are all common logics and logically their groups because the rate education is are already handled by them if returns.

		I 20 minutes also my manager finished the cold and we run the test cases phone the manager over happy. Then I realise sometimes maybe not because not because of your not working hard enough or is it wrong we..After that I got a habit that whenever I start I wanted to go one step back to view my working week is whether it is the correct way if you're at if you're in the wrong way the harder you work the folder you or to the solution.
