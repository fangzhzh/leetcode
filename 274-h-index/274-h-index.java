/*
Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.

class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        int len = citations.length;
        Arrays.sort(citations);
        for(int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            if(citations[i] >= len-i) {
                return len-i;
            } else {
                continue;
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
}
