    Data: data

### Requirement

#### 开篇
Before I jump into the design of the product, I have a couple of questions to clarify the scope of the design in this interview.


#### 总结

产品界限和优先级。 PRD完成，做接口设计

We identifitted all the limitation of our product and the priority list of all our core features.

Upon here, I have to say, PRD should be ready in a team. If not ready, production manager should have enough information to make the first draft of it.



### High level system design
