## Busniess idea & requirement


### Business idea
[产品的分类](./mobileSystemDesign.md#category)

#### 开篇

##### 抽象
First of all, I'd like to explore about the idea behind the product.
* Emerging
* Dominating
* Growing
* Bring a whole new use case to the users

* 如果产品已经存在
I know this product is already exist, and this product is a core component of the whole facebook's product line..

* 如果产品不存在
I'm very excited to have this chance to do a design on the feature and this product will enrich the facebook's product line and bring value to Facebook.

##### 产品
Let me come to the product to explore the scope to find out how do we design this product to fulfill our business idea and our vision.

#### 总结
Based on what I just discussed? It can be conlcuded we have such servicess to sell to our user:

```
    Service: 
        store
        get set
    Data: data
```
Do these make sense?

We've gathered enough information regarding the why/what of the product.

Let me go one step lower to check out how do we design the this product.
  
### Requirement
#### 开篇
Before I jump into the design of the product, I have dozons of questions to clarify the scope of the design in this interview.

* [AS STAR](./mobileSystemDesign.md#question)
    - **A**vailability（可用性）
    - **S**calability（可扩展性）
    - **S**ecurity（安全性）: p2p/server
    - **T**estability（可测试性） : CI/CD
    - **A**ccessibility（可访问性）: accessibility engineer
    - **R**esource（资源管理）
* 问问题的方式
    * 如果是真的问题，那就是
        * I'd like to know do we consider xxx
        * Is it a concern that 
        * Do I have to handle the case
    * 如果需要确认，而不是真的问题
        * Although I have confident on this feature, but I want to make sure that we're on the same page.
        * Battery


#### 总结

    产品界限和优先级。 PRD完成，做接口设计

We identifitted all the limitation of our product and the priority list of all our core features.

Upon here, I have to say, PRD should be ready in a team. If not ready, production manager should have enough information to make the first draft of it.

### High level system design

#### 开篇
    Now I'll define how to split the state and functionality between the server and client sides. This is a crucial step as it will 
determine our communication protocols and overall architecture.

Let's analyze each service we identified earlier and decide where it should reside:

* Service 1: [决定是否放在服务端或客户端，并解释原因]
* Service 2: [决定是否放在服务端或客户端，并解释原因]

For each service, I'll also determine the appropriate communication channel:
* 单向还是双向通信 (Unidirectional vs Bidirectional)
* 流式还是请求-响应式 (Streaming vs Request-Response)
* 具体协议: HTTP REST, WebSocket, 长轮询等

#### 总结
Based on our analysis, here's the high-level system architecture:

[可以口头描述一个简单的架构图，包含客户端、服务端、通信方式等]

This architecture balances our requirements for performance, scalability, and maintainability. I've considered alternatives such as [替代方案1] and [替代方案2], but chose this approach because [原因].

### API design
#### 开篇
Now I'll design the API that will enable communication between our client and server. I'll start with the core services and data entities we identified earlier.

For each service, I'll define:
* API endpoints
* Request/response formats
* Data models
* Pagination strategy where applicable
* Error handling approach

#### 示例API
Let me start with the [主要服务] service:

```
GET /[资源]?[参数] -> [返回数据模型]
POST /[资源] -> [返回数据模型]
PUT /[资源]/[ID] -> [返回数据模型]
DELETE /[资源]/[ID] -> [状态码]
```

数据模型:
```
[模型名称]:
  id: [类型]
  field1: [类型]
  field2: [类型]
  ...
```

#### 总结
This API design provides a clean interface for our client-server communication. I've focused on RESTful principles while ensuring the API is efficient for mobile usage by [优化策略，如减少数据传输量].

### High level client side design
#### 开篇
Now let's design the client-side architecture. I'll use a layered approach to ensure separation of concerns and maintainability.

#### 架构层次
1. **Presentation Layer** (UI)
   * Activities/Fragments
   * ViewModels
   * UI States

2. **Business Layer**
   * Use Cases
   * Business Logic
   * Domain Models

3. **Service Layer**
   * Repository Interfaces
   * Service Interfaces
   * Data Transformations

4. **Data Layer**
   * API Clients
   * Local Database
   * Cache Management
   * External SDKs

#### 数据流
I'll implement a unidirectional data flow pattern (MVI):
* User actions trigger events
* Events are processed by reducers
* State updates flow down to UI
* UI is a pure function of state

#### 总结
This architecture provides several benefits:
* Testability through clear separation of concerns
* Scalability as new features can be added in isolation
* Maintainability with well-defined responsibilities
* Reliability through immutable state management

### Detailed design of key modules
#### 开篇
Let's dive deeper into one critical component: [关键组件名称].

#### 组件设计
This component is responsible for [功能描述]. Here's how it will be implemented:

* Class structure:
  * [类名1]: [职责]
  * [类名2]: [职责]
  * [接口名]: [定义]

* Key algorithms:
  * [算法1]: [简述]
  * [算法2]: [简述]

* State management:
  * [状态1]: [处理方式]
  * [状态2]: [处理方式]

#### 关键挑战与解决方案
A significant challenge in this module is [挑战描述]. I'll address this by [解决方案].

### Complex case handling
#### 开篇
Let's examine one complex scenario: [复杂场景描述].

#### 场景分析
This scenario is challenging because [原因]. Let me walk through how our system will handle it:

1. [步骤1]
2. [步骤2]
3. [步骤3]

#### 边缘情况
We also need to consider these edge cases:
* [边缘情况1]: [处理方式]
* [边缘情况2]: [处理方式]

### 总结
To summarize my design:
1. We identified the core services and data entities
2. We created a balanced client-server architecture
3. We designed a clean API for communication
4. We implemented a layered client architecture with unidirectional data flow
5. We detailed key components and addressed complex scenarios

This design meets our requirements for [关键需求1], [关键需求2], and [关键需求3] while maintaining scalability and maintainability.
