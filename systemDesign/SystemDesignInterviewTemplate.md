# Android System Design Template 2

## Define the scope of the problem.​ 5 minutes
<details><summary>**Why is ti? What is it?**</summary>

* What are the basic requirements of the system?

## HIGH LEVEL DESIGN (5-10 min)
<details><summary>**how** </summary>


## Explore the solution space.​ 5 minutes
1. What kind of data will we need to track? 
1. What kind of database options do we have? 
1. What are their advantages and disadvantages? 
1. Which one would you choose?​

### Ensure the solution is complete.​ 

1. Does this design leave an entire area of the system undescribed? 
1. Does it cover the “send location update” use case end-to-end? How about “receive location update”? 

 

### Ensure the different components of the system are well-defined.​

1. Are the responsibilities between components clear? 
1. Would different people be able to work on different components independently? 
1. Does the architecture help the system scale in the long-term? 
1. What pieces are Activities, and what pieces are Services? How do they interact?

 
### Evaluate trade-offs as you make decisions​

1. What is this system optimal for? 
1. What are its drawbacks? How would you scale this system to new use cases (e.g.: discovering friends in your area?)​

</details>

## DEEP DIVE (15-20 min)
<details><summary>**iterate every component** </summary>
</details>

## Justify your decisions, but be flexible to new information.​ 5 minutes

1. Would you change your design based on a new requirement? 
1. Can you do a rough calculation to justify why you chose one architecture vs the other (e.g.: push vs pull)?
