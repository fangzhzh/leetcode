```
### 1. **Chat App**  
- **Protocols/Services:**  
  - WebSocket (real-time communication)
    - **Mobile Considerations:** 
      - iOS/Android have good native WebSocket support
      - Battery impact when maintaining persistent connections
      - Connection drops during app backgrounding require reconnection logic
      - Network transitions (WiFi to cellular) can break connections
    - **Alternatives:** 
      - **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** 
        - *Pros:* Simpler implementation, works over HTTP. 
        - *Cons:* One-way communication only, no native binary support. 
        - *Mobile:* Good iOS support, Android requires custom implementation, better battery efficiency than WebSockets.
      - **Long Polling** 
        - *Pros:* Works with older browsers, simpler to implement. 
        - *Cons:* Higher latency, more server resources. 
        - *Mobile:* Battery intensive, poor performance on unstable mobile networks, connection drops during background.
      - **gRPC** 
        - *Pros:* Efficient binary protocol, strong typing. 
        - *Cons:* Limited browser support, more complex setup. 
        - *Mobile:* Excellent native support on both iOS/Android, efficient battery usage, handles network transitions well.
  
  - WebRTC (peer-to-peer media)
    - **Mobile Considerations:**
      - iOS support via native APIs (CallKit integration)
      - Android support via WebRTC libraries
      - High battery consumption during active calls
      - Cellular network NAT traversal challenges
    - **Alternatives:**
      - **RTMP** 
        - *Pros:* Well-established, good for streaming. 
        - *Cons:* Flash-based, becoming obsolete. 
        - *Mobile:* Poor native support, high battery consumption, requires custom implementation.
      - **HLS** 
        - *Pros:* Works over HTTP, wide compatibility. 
        - *Cons:* Higher latency, not designed for real-time. 
        - *Mobile:* Native support in iOS, good Android support, battery efficient but high latency.
      - **SIP/RTP** 
        - *Pros:* Industry standard for VoIP. 
        - *Cons:* Complex, higher overhead than WebRTC. 
        - *Mobile:* Mature libraries available, but more battery intensive, deep OS integration possible.
  
  - Redis (pub/sub for message delivery)
    - Mobiel usage: `Mobile Client <---> WebSocket/MQTT/FCM <---> Backend Server <---> Redis`
    - **Why it's needed:** Redis pub/sub provides a lightweight, in-memory message broker that enables real-time message delivery between users in chat applications. It decouples message senders from receivers, allowing for efficient message distribution to multiple clients without direct connections between them.
    - **How it works:** 
      - Clients subscribe to channels (e.g., chat rooms, direct message channels)
      - When a message is published to a channel, Redis delivers it to all subscribers
      - Servers maintain WebSocket connections with clients and forward Redis messages
      - Enables horizontal scaling as any server can publish/subscribe to channels
      - Provides low-latency message delivery with minimal overhead
    - **Mobile Considerations:**
      - Not directly used on mobile, but affects mobile experience
      - Message delivery reliability impacts mobile UX
      - Offline message handling strategy needed
    - **Alternatives:**
      - **NATS** 
        - *Pros:* Higher throughput, simpler architecture. 
        - *Cons:* Less mature ecosystem. 
        - *Mobile:* Client libraries available but limited mobile-specific optimizations.
      - **RabbitMQ** 
        - *Pros:* More features, better persistence. 
        - *Cons:* More complex, potentially higher latency. 
        - *Mobile:* Client libraries available, but not optimized for mobile constraints.
      - **Firebase Cloud Messaging** 
        - *Pros:* Designed for mobile, handles device token management. 
        - *Cons:* Google dependency. 
        - *Mobile:* Excellent battery efficiency, native integration with iOS/Android, handles offline message delivery.
  
  - Kafka (event streaming)
    - **Why it's needed:** Kafka provides a distributed **event** streaming platform that enables reliable, scalable, and durable message processing for chat applications. It handles high-throughput message streams while maintaining message ordering and persistence, making it ideal for processing chat events, analytics, and integrations with other systems.
    - **How it works:** 
      - Messages are organized into topics (e.g., message_sent, user_presence, typing_indicator)
      - Topics are partitioned for parallel processing and scalability
      - Messages are stored durably with configurable retention
      - Consumer groups allow for load-balanced processing across services
      - Enables event-driven architecture for decoupled system components
    - Exmaple When a client sends a message(An event):
      1. The client sends the message to the backend API
      2. The backend publishes the event to the message_sent topic
      3. Multiple services consume this topic to:
          - Store the message in the database
          - Forward it to recipients via WebSockets
          - Generate push notifications
          - Update unread counts
          - Trigger analytics events

      - Not directly used on mobile, but affects system architecture
      - Impacts message ordering and delivery guarantees

### 4. **Google Docs** (Collaborative Editing)  
OT is the older of the two technologies and is used by Google Docs, Etherpad, and many other collaborative editors.
#### How it works:
1. Each edit is represented as an operation (insert, delete, etc.)
2. When operations occur concurrently, they are transformed against each other
3. Transformations ensure that applying operations in different orders still results in the same document state

#### CRDTs are a newer approach used by systems like Figma, Notion, and newer collaborative editors.

##### How it works:
1. Each character/element gets a unique identifier in a logical position space
2. Operations are designed to be commutative (order doesn't matter)
3. No transformation needed - concurrent edits naturally merge
